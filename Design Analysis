# Background
I'm an Ecommerce Database Analyst for an online retailer which has just launched their first product. I will analyze and optimize marketing channels, measure and test website conversion
performance, and use data to understand the impact of changes to the website.

# Purpose
Analyze and optimize the business’ marketing channels, website, and product portfolio.

# Abstract
Ecommerce websites are in a constant state of change to optimize their investments in driving web traffic and optimizing the sales funnel for their products and services. 
These websites track performance using key performance indicators (KPI) to measure the sites ability to drive sales and increase return of investment (ROI). 
In this analysis, I aimed to examine the sites performance to drive sales by identifying top traffic sources (paid search versus organic) and measuring their conversion rates (CVR), 
analyzing trends in CVR and web traffic hitting the site, using segmentation (desktop versus mobile) for bidding optimization,  calculating bounce rates, and 
building conversion funnels for top landing pages.

My analysis examined the reasons for the monthly percentage change in conversion rates for the 2012 year. From this trend analysis, a top down approach 
of the website’s pages were analyzed to pinpoint any factors impacting these conversion rates from month to month.

The addition of two new landing pages, ‘lander-1’ and ‘billing-2’ coincided with significant increases in CVR by 22% and 17% respectively for the months highlighted in the analysis. 
Multiple A/B split tests were used to confirm the findings which saw an overall 8% decrease in bounce rate for traffic landing on ‘lander-1’ and a ‘15%’ increase in click-through 
rate for the ‘billing-2’ page leading to a lift of $8.51 of revenue per order.   

My data insights revealed the cause and effect relationship between the competitive and elusive landscape of the e-commerce environment and a website’s inherent need 
to adapt their strategies for their products and services and find those consumers who will derive the most benefit.
