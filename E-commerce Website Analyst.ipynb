    "A conversion rate of 2.9% for paid traffic was perhaps too low for a new business looking for a higher ROI. Unlike a mature retail business with economies of scale that can withstand lower ROI if future earnings can be realized, a newer business needs to see greater return on their investments since their forecast models are more susceptible to change. Obviously, ROI requirements vary drastically based on the industry being examined.\n",

With sessions decreasing, an increase in CVR should result. Ultimately, companies want maximum volume, but don’t want to spend more on ads than what's necessary. Companies need to see a positive ROI to ensure their campaign is a worthwhile endeavor. "
